# Chef

> Chef is an open-source automation platform built to address the hardest infrastructure challenges on the planet. Chef gives you the power and flexibility you need to move faster in a complex world - from rapid provisioning and deployment of servers to the automated delivery of applications and servicesâ€”at any scale.

# Mocking HTTP Response body for rSpec

I'm sure there are many ways to do this -- probably better ways -- but this is a simple way I've done it.

    :::ruby
    class FakeResponse
      attr :body
      def initialize body
        @body = body
      end
    end

    describe Foo do
      before(:each) do
        @data = File.read "./http/response/body.txt"
        Net::HTTP.stub!(:post_form).and_return(FakeResponse.new @data)
      end
      it "should return stuff" do
        Foo.fetch( :key => "foo", :uri => "http://foobar.com/" ).should eq(@data)
      end
    end


#### Note:
> Since originally coming up with this, I found [VCR](http://rubygems.org/gems/vcr), check it out, it does this type of thing in some very cool ways.

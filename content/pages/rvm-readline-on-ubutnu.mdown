Summary: How to get readline working under irb with RVM on Ubuntu.

# RVM, irb, readline and Ubuntu

It's as easy as:

    :::shell
    sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev
    rvm remove ruby-1.9.3-p194
    rvm install ruby-1.9.3-p194

Done.

### Notes: 

1. Do not use `rvm pkg install readline`.
2. "1.9.3-p194" is an example, should work with most versions.

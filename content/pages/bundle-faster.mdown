# Bundle Faster, Save Time

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) just annouced `1.4.0.pre.1` with `--jobs` support, which allows for multithreading gem installs -- I haven't looked at the code, but my guess is it's making use of the `JOBS` flag support in `gmake` (which multithreads C compilation) for navtive libs. 

Anyway, here's my quick timing comparison on bundling a very large project with hundrends of gems:

``` bash
rm -rf vendor/bundle
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
# time: 5:31.40 total

rm -rf vendor/bundle
gem install bundler -v 1.4.0.pre.1 --pre
bundle install --jobs=4 --path vendor/bundle
# time: 3:10.38 total
```

Enjoy!

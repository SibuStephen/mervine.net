# Hacks

A place to save and share all the nasty little hacks that make the world go round and round.

> The word "hacker" has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers. In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things, it can be used for good or bad, but the vast majority of hackers Iâ€™ve met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world.

Title: Mongocached: Simple Cache using Mongodb
Categories: ruby, mongo, memcached, cache, mongodb
Summary: I created [Mongocached](http://mongocached.rubyops.net/), with help from [Hector Virgen](http://www.virgentech.com/), as a simple shared cacheing layer for things like html fragments and database calls as a follow up to [Diskcached](http://mongocached.rubyops.net/). It specifically targets situations where you want to cache large amounts of data and have memory constraints.

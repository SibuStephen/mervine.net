# Notes: List of Install Scripts

> Notes: 
>
> 1. Chances are these were run on CentOS5, CentOS6 *OR* Ubuntu only. Perhaps more then one, perhaps only one. 
> 2. The version in the script isn't always the latest version, but the version at time I last updated the script.
> 3. **Unless you're me, you should use these as reference. I don't recommend running them, without knowing what you're doing.**

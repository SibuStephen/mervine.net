# Notes: Finding Older Files

In this example, I'm finding all files older then 14 days and removing them.

    :::shell
    $ find . -type f -not -mtime 14 | xargs rm
    
In this example, I'm finding top level directoies in `/foo/bar/bah` that are more then 30 days old and removing them.

    :::shell
    $ find /foo/bar/bah -type d -not -mtime 30 -maxdepth 0 | xargs rm -rf
    
I typically use this for removing, which is why I've used that as an example. This type of thing is great for a cronjob...

    :::shell
    # remove old files daily at 1am
    * 1 * * * find /foo/bar/bah -type d -not -mtime 30 -maxdepth 0 | xargs rm -rf

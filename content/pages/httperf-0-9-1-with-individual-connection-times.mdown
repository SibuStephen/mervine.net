# httperf-0.9.1 with individual connection times

This past weekend I dabbled in C++ for the first time patching httperf to use display each connection's timing when using verbose mode.

You can find the source here -- [https://github.com/rubyops/httperf](https://github.com/rubyops/httperf)

#### Basic installation:

    $ git clone https://github.com/rubyops/httperf
    $ cd httperf
    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Note: the [--prefix=/usr/local] is optional and allows you to run two instances of httperf, one at it's default location "/usr/bin/httperf" and this one at "/usr/local/bin/httperf". It's not really necessary, but just incase you're not willing or able to remove your previous installation, it may prove helpful.

#### Usage:

Simple... use httperf as you always have with the verbose flag.

See: [Performance Testing with Httperf](http://mervine.net/2012/07/30/performance_testing_with_httperf) for more information on using httperf.


#### Sample output:

    httperf --verbose --client=0/1 --server=mervine.net --port=80 --uri=/ --rate=1 \
      --send-buffer=4096 --recv-buffer=16384 --num-conns=10 --num-calls=1

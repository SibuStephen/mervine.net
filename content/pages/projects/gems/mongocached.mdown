# Mongocached

I created Mongocached, with help from [Hector Virgen](http://www.virgentech.com/), as a simple shared cacheing layer for things like html fragments and database calls as a follow up to [Diskcached](/gems/diskcached). It specifically targets situations where you want to cache large amounts of data and have memory constraints.

### Installation

    :::shell
    gem install mongocached

*Or with Bundler:*

    :::ruby
    source :rubygems
    gem 'mongocached'

### Basic Usage

    :::ruby
    $cache = Mongocached.new()

    # with auth
    # $cache = Mongocached.new({ username: 'uname', password: 'pword' })

    # memcached style
    $cache.set('key', 'data')
    $cache.get('key')

    # block stlye
    $cache.save('key') do
        'data'
    end

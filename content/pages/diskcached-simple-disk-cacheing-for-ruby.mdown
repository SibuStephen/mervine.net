Title: Diskcached: Simple Disk Cacheing for Ruby
Categories: ruby, sinatra, diskcached, memcached, cache, github, httperf, mongodb
Summary: I created [Diskcached](https://github.com/rubyops/diskcached/wiki) as a simple cacheing layer for things like html fragments and database calls. I thought about using [memcached](http://memcached.org/), but as [Ditty](http://ditty.rubyops.net/) is running on a single server, it seemed overkill. Additionally, I looked at using [rack-cache](http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/), but I felt it was a bit more complex then I was looking for. So Diskcached was born (although it was origiionally released as "simple\_disk\_cache" -- for about 12 hours).

# Diskcached: Simple Disk Cacheing for Ruby

### Introduction

I created [Diskcached](https://github.com/rubyops/diskcached/wiki) as a simple cacheing layer for things like html fragments and database calls. I thought about using [memcached](http://memcached.org/), but as [Ditty](http://ditty.rubyops.net/) is running on a single server, it seemed overkill. Additionally, I looked at using [rack-cache](http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache/), but I felt it was a bit more complex then I was looking for. So Diskcached was born (although it was origiionally released as "simple\_disk\_cache" -- for about 12 hours).


### Updates

##### 2012-07-10
* [Released v1.1.0](https://github.com/rubyops/diskcached/blob/v1.1.0/HISTORY.md)

* To the comment: "I 'm not clear how memcached on a single server is overkill."
  1. In some cases -- e.g. Dreamhost shared hosting and Heroku (I believe) -- it is difficult, if not impossible to install memcached. This is for those situations.
  1. In all cases, disk space is cheaper than memory. For example, I use [myhosting.com](http://myhosting.com), which charges $1 per 20G of disk storage and $1 per 512MB of memory. So in my case, I use Diskcached instead of memcached and my memory foot print is ~300MB. While at the moment, I could very easily handle running memcached without running out of memory, using disk based cacheing allows me to scale much further before having to upgrade my hosting package. Additionally, if you [check out my blogs performance metrics](https://github.com/jmervine/ditty/wiki/Performance), you'll see that Diskcached brought me from ~140ms render times, to ~1ms render times, allowing me to scale even further.

* To the comment: "If you need memcache...then use it."
  1. I totally agree!

### Installation

    gem install diskcached

Or with [Bundler](/tag/bundler):

    source :rubygems
    gem 'diskcached'



### Basic Usage

#### My Style

    require 'diskcached'
    @diskcache = Diskcached.new

    result = @diskcache.cache('expensive_code') do 
      # some expensive code
    end

    puts result

The above will create the cache if it doesn't exist and cache the result of block and return it. If the cache exists and isn't expired, it will read from the cache and returnwhat's stored. This allows you to passively wrap code in a cache block and not worry about checking to see if it's valid or expired. 

Also worth noting, it will return "nil" if something goes wrong.


#### Memcached Style

Using Diskcached like this should allow for a "drag and drop" replacement of Memcached, should you so decide.

    require 'diskcached'
    @diskcache = Diskcached.new

    begin
      result = @diskcache.get('expensive_code')
    rescue # Diskcached::NotFound # prevents easy replacement, but is safer.
      result = run_expensive_code
      @diskcache.set('expensive_code', result)
    end

    puts result

It's important to note that Diskcached is quite a bit simpler then Memcached and in some ways more forgiving. If Memcached compatability is really important, refer to Memcached docs as well as Diskcached docs when implementing your code.


### Benchamarks

#### Comments

Diskcached wasn't designed to be a faster solution, just a simpler
one when compaired to Memcached. However, from these benchmarks,
it holds up will and even should provide slightly faster reads.


#### Ruby 1.8.7

**Warning:** Tests do not pass and therefore this isn't expected 
to actaully work on ruby 1.8.7 at this point. I'm including the
benchmarks for it as an academic excercise.

#### Sinatra Application 'httperf' results.

On a development machine (Unicorn w/ 1 worker) I ran a series of [httperf](http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/) tests to see how Diskcached ran in real world situations. You can [checkout the full output from multiple examples here](https://gist.github.com/3062334), but there's a taste...

Using the endpoint [http://rubyops.net/](http://rubyops.net/) on my dev server and hitting it 100,000 times --

# MongoMapper: Overwriting a Collection Name

I found this very hard to find online, so I'm dropping a post in here with it. To overwrite a collection name when using [MongoMapper](http://mongomapper.com/) build your model like so:

    require 'mongomapper'
    class Collection
      include MongoMapper::Document
      # default collection name is "collections" which
      # looks for 'db.collections' in mongo.

      set_collection_name "some_collections"
      # new collection name is "some_collections" which
      # looks for 'db.some_collections' in mongo.

      key :some_data, String

    end

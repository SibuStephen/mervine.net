Summary: I recently went through setting up syntax highlighting on Nesta for this site. I started with "Setting up rack-codehighlighter" from the Nesta site, but wasn't loving what Coderay had to offer. Looking at 'rack-codehighlighter' and it's other formatter options and decided to use Ultraviolet.<br/><br/>While this is geared towards Nesta, this will also work for all Rack applications, especially those built on Sinatra.


# Syntax Highlighting on Nesta

I recently went through setting up syntax highlighting on [Nesta][1] for this site. I started with [Setting up rack-codehighlighter][5] from the [Nesta site][2], but wasn't loving what [Coderay][6] had to offer. Looking at [rack-codehighlighter][3] and it's other formatter options and decided to use [Ultraviolet][4].

While this is geared towards [Nesta][1], this will also work for all [Rack](/rack) applications, especially those built on [Sinatra](/sinatra).

## Right from the Book

If you take a look at [Nesta's post][5], the go over this part pretty well with [coderay][6], but that's not what I wanted. So, to get us started, I'm going to take what they have and adapt it to [Ultraviolet][4], but with less description -- examples speak for themselves IMO.

#### Step 1 - Add rack-codehighlighter


In your `Gemfile` add

    :::ruby
    # file: Gemfile
    gem 'ultraviolet', :require => 'uv'
    gem 'rack-codehighlighter', :require => 'rack/codehighlighter'

and then run

    $ bundle

#### Step 2 - Initialize rack-codehighlighter

Add the following to your `config.ru`

    :::ruby
    # ... omitted code above ...
    use Rack::Codehighlighter,
      :ultraviolet,
      :theme => "twilight",
        # see ultraviolet's site for more theme options
      :lines => false,
      :markdown => true,
      :element => "pre>code",
      :pattern => /\A:::(\w+)\s*(\n|&#x000A;)/i,
      :logging => false

    require 'nesta/app'
    run Nesta::App

#### Step 3 - Download Theme CSS

I had trouble finding a download location for these files, so I took them right from [Ultraviolet's site][4] using the following script

    :::ruby
    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    %w{
      css/sunburst.css
      css/active4d.css
      css/all_hallows_eve.css
      css/amy.css
      css/blackboard.css
      css/brilliance_black.css
      css/brilliance_dull.css
      css/cobalt.css
      css/dawn.css
      css/eiffel.css
      css/espresso_libre.css
      css/idle.css
      css/iplastic.css
      css/lazy.css
      css/mac_classic.css
      css/magicwb_amiga.css
      css/pastels_on_dark.css
      css/slush_poppies.css
      css/spacecadet.css
      css/twilight.css
      css/zenburnesque.css
    }.each do |css|
      puts css
      system("curl http://ultraviolet.rubyforge.org/#{css} > uv_#{css.split("/").last.split(".").first}.scss")
    end

Run with

    $ ruby ./css.rb

You should have created the following files

      uv_active4d.scss
      uv_all_hallows_eve.scss
      uv_amy.scss
      uv_blackboard.scss
      uv_brilliance_black.scss
      uv_brilliance_dull.scss
      uv_cobalt.scss
      uv_dawn.scss
      uv_eiffel.scss
      uv_espresso_libre.scss
      uv_idle.scss
      uv_iplastic.scss
      uv_lazy.scss
      uv_mac_classic.scss
      uv_magicwb_amiga.scss
      uv_pastels_on_dark.scss
      uv_slush_poppies.scss
      uv_spacecadet.scss
      uv_sunburst.scss
      uv_twilight.scss
      uv_zenburnesque.scss

> Note: this should be run inside your `themes/THEME_NAME/views` directory.

#### Step 4 - Import Your Theme's Style

Update your `themes/THEME_NAME/views/master.sass` with the following

    :::sass
    @import "uv_twilight.scss"

> Note: I had better results putting this as the last line of the file, however, it shouldn't really matter.

#### Step 5 - [Optional] Update Your Pages and Articles

For the best results, you'll need to tell your syntax highligher what language you're working in. To do this, updated your code samples with `:::<lang>`.

Ruby example

    :::ruby
    class Foo
      def bar
        "Bazinga!"
      end
    end

HAML example

    :::haml
    :::haml
    %p.foo
      %b.bar
        =bazinga

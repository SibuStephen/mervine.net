# Github: Hello World

I found this while poking around on [github.com](http://github.com) and found a list of "Hello World!" applications in (what they claim to be) every programming language.
> #### [github.com/git/hello-world](http://github.com/git/hello-world)

Thought it was neat, thought I would share.

Title: Thin Wrapper Script

# Thin Wrapper Script

Their may be others, there may be better, but this is mine.

    :::shell
    # file: APP_ROOT/thin.sh
    #
    # Directory pathing context should be that of the thin
    # init script sourcing this file, not this file itself.
    #
    # allow for overides as such
    test "$RACK_ENV"  || RACK_ENV="production"
    test "$THIN_PORT" || THIN_PORT="4321"
    test "$THIN_PID"  || THIN_PID="./log/listener.pid"
    test "$THIN_LOG"  || THIN_LOG="./log/listener.log"

    # force defaults as such
    #RACK_ENV="development"
    #THIN_PORT="4321"
    #THIN_PID="./log/listener.pid"
    #THIN_LOG="./log/listener.log"

    # vim: set filetype=sh

And if you need external configs...

    :::shell
    # file: APP_ROOT/config/thinrc
    #
    # Directory pathing context should be that of the thin
    # init script sourcing this file, not this file itself.
    #
    # allow for overides as such
    test "$RACK_ENV"  || RACK_ENV="production"
    test "$THIN_PORT" || THIN_PORT="4321"
    test "$THIN_PID"  || THIN_PID="./log/listener.pid"
    test "$THIN_LOG"  || THIN_LOG="./log/listener.log"

    # force defaults as such
    #RACK_ENV="development"
    #THIN_PORT="4321"
    #THIN_PID="./log/listener.pid"
    #THIN_LOG="./log/listener.log"

    # vim: set filetype=sh

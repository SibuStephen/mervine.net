Title: Web Pasting with "gistcli"

[Found this simple Python script which allows for cli gist posts](https://github.com/pranavk/gist-cli) -- (thanks to [pranavk](http://github.com/pranavk)).


You can install it like so

    $ mkdir ~/bin
    $ echo "export PATH=~/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
    $ cd ~/bin
    $ wget https://raw.github.com/pranavk/gist-cli/master/gistcli
    $ chmod 755 gistcli
    $ source ~/.zshrc

Usage examples

    # simple echo to gist
    echo "test gist" | gistcli

    # file to gist
    gistcli -f myfile.txt

    # private 
    echo "ssssh, don't tell anyone!" | gistcli -p

    # from tty, EOF from '.' on it's own line
    gistcli -
    Foo, bar bah bing!
    .


> Note: 
> There's also a slightly more mature [Ruby](/ruby) gist cli tool at [github.com/defunkt/gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist) but I had issues getting it to work with my RMV setup.

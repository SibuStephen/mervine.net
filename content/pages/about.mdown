# About
 
Welcome to RubyOps.net.

I'm starting this blog as a place to "take notes" on the various different problems I encounter in supporting Ruby applications from a Dev Ops perspective. 

This blog is running on [Nesta][Nesta], a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) based blog application.

I have extended [Nesta][Nesta] by writing the following plugins:

1. [nesta-plugin-google-ads](http://github.com/jmervine/nesta-plugin-google-ads)
1. [nesta-plugin-sharethis](http://github.com/jmervine/nesta-plugin-sharethis)
1. [nesta-plugin-diskcached](http://github.com/jmervine/nesta-diskcached)

Additionally you can find the source for [RubyOps.net](http://www.rubyops.net/) at [http://github.com/rubyops/www.rubyops.net](http://github.com/rubyops/www.rubyops.net).

Thanks!

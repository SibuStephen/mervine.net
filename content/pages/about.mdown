# About

Welcome to mervine.net.

I'm starting this blog as a place to "take notes" on the various different problems I encounter in supporting web applications from a Dev Ops perspective.

This blog is running on [Nesta][Nesta], a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) based blog application.

Additionally you can find the source for [mervine.net](http://mervine.net/) at [http://github.com/jmervine/mervine.net](http://github.com/jmervine/mervine.net).

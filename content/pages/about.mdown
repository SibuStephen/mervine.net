# About
 
Welcome to RubyOps.net.

I'm starting this blog as a place to "take notes" on the various different problems I encounter in supporting Ruby applications from a Dev Ops perspective. 

This blog is running on [Nesta][Nesta], a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) based blog application.

Additionally you can find the source for [RubyOps.net](http://www.rubyops.net/) at [http://github.com/rubyops/www.rubyops.net](http://github.com/rubyops/www.rubyops.net).

## Contributors

I'm always looking for guest posters and contributors to RubyOps.net. I'm not expert, just someone who does it for fun and a living. If you want to join me, scold me, show me up, etc. Send me [an email](mailto:joshua@mervine.net) with your [github](http://github.com/) account or leave a comment and I'll get back to you.

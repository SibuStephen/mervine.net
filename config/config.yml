# You can stick with the default look and feel, or use a theme. Themes are
# easy to create or install, and live inside the themes directory. You
# can also use scripts/theme to install them.

# cache
#     Set it to true if you'd like Nesta to cache your pages in ./public.
#     Useful if you're deploying Nesta with a proxy server such as Nginx,
#     but not in the least bit helpful if your pages are dynamic, or you're
#     deploying Nesta to Heroku.
